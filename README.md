# Prototyping a Car Park Billing/ Reservation System

## Synposis

Intercom: Arduino Uno - user's connect to intercom via Bluetooth to enter/ leave car park and recieve billing. Using a Bluetooth Shield module for bluetooth communication to device.

User Device: Wep Application GUI - Allows users to connect to Car Park, recieve billing and check availability of Car Park prior to leaving.

Database: PGSQL Server - Used to store data about Car Park and intercom devices so users and administrators can acess intercom data remotely through GUI

Sensors: Temperature - for temperature around Intercom, Motion - to detect unstable movement of intercom and Battery Level -  to check level of back up power source for Arduino.

## Code Example

### Example 1
USER: Opens web site GUI to Home page
GUI: Navbar at top allows user to go to: Home, Connect, Admin Login ( Shown on every page). Home - Displays all Car Parks, their max capacity, availability, price per hour and address. Grabbing these values from the PGSQL Database.
USER: Select Connect page.
GUI: Shows form: Entering or Leaving?, Select Car Park and Enter username.
USER: Entering, Car Park 1, lfet.
GUI: Calls procedure to connect to Car Park 1 intercom (Arduino), if succesfull requests to enter user in car park. Intercom returns confirmation of time entering.
GUI: Displays confirmation and time entering (User: lfet entered at H: 12 M: 34).

USER: Opens web site GUI to Home page
GUI: Displays home page
USER: Select Connect page.
GUI: Shows form: Entering or Leaving?, Select Car Park and Enter username.
USER: Leaving, Car Park 1, lfet.
GUI: Calls procedure to connect to Car Park 1 intercom (Arduino), if succesfull requests to leave user from car park. Intercom returns confirmation and total time spent occupying car park.
GUI: Displays reciept by getting price per hour from DB and time spent from Arduino. (User: lfet stayed in Car Park 1 for H: 2 M: 30. Cost $12)

### Example 2

ADMIN: Opens web sit GUI to Home Page
GUI: Displays home page.
Admin: Select Admin Login.
GUI: Shows login form for Admin.
Admin: Username: dmit, Password: 000
GUI: Shows information for all Car Parks including state of sensors, Battery Level, Temperature and Motion.

### Example 3

Temperature sensor detects overheating at Intercom
LCD: Displays warning on LCD so Admin can easily check at the Car Park
